Changes to Portfolio Site:

- Implemented a Quote of The Day section on index.html as a fun way to incoporate calling an API endpoint.

3rd Party Scripts:

- Added Google Analytics to keep track of information about the site and engagment. I think this is important because it will allow me to understand whether recruiters are paying attention to my content and whether they are engaged and if they are not, how I can change things to make them more engaged.
